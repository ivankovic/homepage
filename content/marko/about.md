I have 10 years of experience building tools and processes for other engineers
in the biggest software engineering enterprise in the world. I have built
cutting edge tools that scale to tens of thousands of engineers and billions of
lines of code. I have extensive experience developing planetary scale
distributed systems.

I am a world class expert in code coverage, mutation testing, large scale code
analysis, large scale refactoring and machine learning.

I manage an organization of ~25 engineers, leading multiple teams focused on
improving the internal developer experience at Google.

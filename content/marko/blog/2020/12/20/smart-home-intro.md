# Introduction

This series of blog posts is my laboratory notebook as I try, and hopefully
succeed in upgrading a 14 year old central european house into a smart home.

# Starting point

The house is 14 years old. It is a well built central european house, with a
two-shell external walls made from reinforced concrete and bricks, internal
walls made from bricks or reinforced concrete and cieling made exclusively from
reinforced concrete. This makes the North-American techniques of pulling new
wires through drywall non-applicable.

The standard 230V/50Hz electrical wiring is pulled through the house. Ethernet
is partially pulled through. Rooms above ground do have Cat 5 ethernet ports,
but only one port each. There is no ethernet in the basement. However, there is
an old ISDN cable going from the basement to the ground floor.

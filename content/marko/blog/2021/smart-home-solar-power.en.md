# Solar potential

My house has excellent solar potential. It's roughly on 47 degrees north. One entire
side of the roof has an azimuth of about 220 degrees and a declination of 31
degrees. The total usable surface for the panels is 62 square meters.

The roof is big enough for 36 panels. 24 at a declination of 31 degrees
and 12 at 10 degrees. With 330 wP panels this sums up to 11.8 kWp. The local
utility company that installed the system projects a yearly production of
12.2 MWh.

# Current results

The system has been running since December 2020. The best day so far was the
30th of May 2021 when the system produced 81.3 kWh in a single day. Unfortunately
the summer of 2021 was exceptionally rainy for Europe, so the system didn't quite
reach it's full potential, but even so it has produced 9.9 MWh in the first 8 months
of the year. Given that the darker winter months are now coming, the projected 12.2 MWh
seems spot on.

# Surprises so far

I was surprised to see that the panels do not produce peak output in the summer
months. This is when I learned that panels are usually rated at 25 degrees Celsius
and in the sumer my roof was easily going over 30 degrees. The loss was substantial.
The system did not reach it's peak value even once in August, but it overshot the peak
rated value in May. So far the largest value reported by my power inverter was
13.1 kW, and the rated peak is only 11.88 kW. This was on a sunny but windy day
in May.

I have 10 years of experience building tools and processes for other engineers
in the biggest software engineering enterprise in the world. I have built
cutting edge tools that scale to tens of thousands of engineers and billions of
lines of code. I have extensive experience developing planetary scale
distributed systems.

I am a world class expert in code coverage, mutation testing, large scale code
analysis, large scale refactoring and machine learning.

I manage an organization of ~25 engineers, leading multiple teams focused on
improving the internal developer experience at Google.

## Work history

*  Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google (2020. - present)
   * Technical lead in the Engineering Productivity group. Technical equivalent
   to Senior Engineering Manager.

*  Staff Software Engineer at Google (2016. - 2020.)
   * Technical lead in the Engineering Productivity group. Technical equivalent
   to Engineering Manager.

*  Senior Software Engineer, Tools and Infrastructure at Google (2014. - 2016.)
   * Technical lead in the Ads Engineering Productivity group. Conceptualized,
     designed, implemented and owned code coverage infrastructure for the whole
     company. Implemented large scale code analysis infrastructure.

*  Software Engineer, Tools and Infrastructure at Google (2011. - 2014.)
   * Implemented bespoke developer infrastructure for Google Shopping teams.

*  Intern, Software Engineer at Google (2010.)
   *  Implemented a load and performance testing framework including result
      visualization.

*  IOI 2007 - Evaluation Committee (2007.)
   *  One of the two authors of the IOI 2007 evaluation system.

*  Croatian Open Competition in Informatics - Scientific Committee (2007. -
   2011.)
   *   One of the key developers of the evaluation system that was used for
       more than a decade for the Croatian Open Competition in Informatics. I
       organized task authors and contributed many tasks myself. As the chief
       of the committee I was the person ultimately responsible for the
       integrity of both the international open competition and the national
       proctored competition.

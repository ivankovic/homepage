## Technical Leadership

*  **AI for Code** - Engineered a transformative AI model for code and developed it
    into a product that automatically reviews code for all Google engineers ([blogpost](https://blog.research.google/2023/05/large-sequence-models-for-software.html)).
*  **Software testing** - Groundbreaking coverage infrastructure ([paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3338906.3340459)) sped up
   code reviews at Google by 5% and reduced the code review costs by 11%
   ([paper](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2024/icse-2024-software-engineering-in-practice/22/Productive-Coverage-Improving-the-Actionability-of-Code-Coverage)). Invented an entirely new type of code coverage, Productive
   Coverage ([paper](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2024/icse-2024-software-engineering-in-practice/22/Productive-Coverage-Improving-the-Actionability-of-Code-Coverage)) that further reduced code review cost by further 2% and
   improved code and test quality.
*  **Code quality** - Co-owned the dead code deletion system that deleted more than 5% of all C++ code at Google and almost half a billion lines total ([blogpost](https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/04/sensenmann-code-deletion-at-scale.html)).
*  Many other projects, including mutation testing, code change analysis, resource usage optimization and reliability and failure analysis.

## Organizational Leadership

*  Managed an organization of 50 people
*  Managed managers of managers
*  Mentored junior, senior and staff level employees
*  Drove projects at every stage of development, from idea to long term production operations
*  Hiring and performance management

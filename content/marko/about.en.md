# 14 Years of experience in Software Engineering

Leading cutting edge technical work:

*  **AI Software Engineer** - Engineered a transformative AI model for code and deployed it in
a product that automatically reviews code for all Google engineers. Built a system that
automatically produces full stack applications at [Cogna](https://www.cogna.co/).
*  **Code quality** - Co-owned the dead code deletion system that deleted more than 5% of all
C++ code at Google and almost half a billion lines total.
*  **Software testing** - Groundbreaking coverage infrastructure that sped up code reviews at
Google by 5% and reduced the code review costs by 11%. Invented an entirely new type of code
coverage, Productive Coverage that further reduced code review cost by further 2% and improved
code and test quality.

Other projects, including code change analysis, resource usage optimization and reliability
and failure analysis.

Organizational Leadership:

*  VP at a Series A scale-up
*  Managed an organization of 50 people
*  Mentored junior, senior and staff level employees
*  Drove projects at every stage of development, from idea to long term production operations.

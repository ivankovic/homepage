First post on the new blog
==========================

In an effort to promote decentralisation and DIY culture, I am no longer using Blogger and instead code the whole thing by hand as static content using [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/about/).

I lose the dynamic content, but I make it up in post size! The total transfer size as reported by the Chrome network tools for this page is 117 bytes, compared to the 42.5 KB for the Blogspot article. Or a hilarious reduction of 99.73%.

The setup is loosely based on the [excellent tutorial](http://clarkdave.net/2012/02/building-a-static-blog-with-nanoc/) by Dave Clark.

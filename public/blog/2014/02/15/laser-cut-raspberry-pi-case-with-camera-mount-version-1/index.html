<p>I feel very happy that I live in a time when hobby laser cutters are a thing. Yay Science!</p>

<h2 id="my-first-project">My first project</h2>

<p>My first project: A Raspberry PI case with a camera mount. I have a few of these around my apartment acting as a security system. Up until now, they looked more or less like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/raspberry-pi-case-before.jpg" alt="An image of a barebone PI with the camera module sellotaped to a box" /></p>

<p>This has a nice punk feel to it, but it’s somewhat vulnerable to things falling on it, or it falling off things. So for my first project, I remixed the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:142608">Raspberry PI Case (with Camera)</a> by <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/raster/overview">raster</a>. I had to modify it a bit. The most important modification is to extend the holes to fit 3mm acrylic sheets, the holes in the original design are just a tiny bit too narrow. Just to try things out, I also added round air holes and a bit of engraving. The result:</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>This case is really cool, but I dislike the screw mounting for the camera. It’s fine for this particular camera because it is just sitting on a shelf, but for my next one, I need something that can be moved independently of the case mount. It will be fun to design something like that.</p>

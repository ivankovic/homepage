  <h1>Technical details</h1>
    <h2>Why does it look so basic?</h2>
      <p>
        It's all about the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CSS has been handcrafted for maximum legibility. It uses clear, high contrast
        black and white colours with the minimum use of blue required to distinguish links.
        Bold is used to draw attention, and spacing is used to allow for easy flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        It works well on most screen orientations, resolutions, brightness levels and also
        works well with text based browsers and screen readers, as well as automated crawlers.
      </p>
    <h2>How is it so fast?</h2>
      <p>
        The content is completely handcrafted and uses only simple HTML. It is very small, the
        index page is only 880 bytes, and has very high cache timeout.
      </p>
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This is our personal website. It only has visitors, not users. We store only
        the very bare minimum required to technically serve the content, and nothing else.
      </p>

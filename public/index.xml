      <description>Solar potential My house has excellent solar potential. It&amp;rsquo;s roughly on 47 degrees north. One entire side of the roof has an azimuth of about 220 degrees and a declination of 31 degrees. The total usable surface for the panels is 62 square meters.
The roof is big enough for 36 panels. 24 at a declination of 31 degrees and 12 at 10 degrees. With 330 wP panels this sums up to 11.</description>

      <description>I have recently started to switch more and more of my content consumption to email. Instead of using any social network, like Reddit or Twitter, I subscribe to newsletters directly. This has worked great so far. Every day, I get the hot news from news outlets like BBC, and every few days I get more creative or long form content like XKCD scripts, delivered directly to my inbox.
However, I am not always interested in cosuming the content, and I also don&amp;rsquo;t really want to spend time cleaning up my email when I read something.</description>

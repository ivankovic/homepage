AI Software Engineer - Engineered a transformative AI model for code and deployed it in a product that automatically reviews code for all Google engineers. Built a system that automatically produces full stack applications at Cogna. Code quality - Co-owned the dead code deletion system that deleted more than 5% of all C++ code at Google and almost half a billion lines total. Software testing - Groundbreaking coverage infrastructure that sped up code reviews at Google by 5% and reduced the code review costs by 11%. Invented an entirely new type of code coverage, Productive Coverage that further reduced code review cost by further 2% and improved code and test quality.
